* APM X-Gene SoC Queue Manager/Traffic Manager nodes

QMTM nodes are defined to describe on-chip Queue Managers in APM X-Gene SoC.
APM X-Gene SoC Ethernet, PktDMA (XOR Engine), and Security Engine subsystems
communicate with a central Queue Manager using messages which include
information about the work to be performed and the location of the associated
data buffers. There are multiple instances of QMTM. Each QMTM instance has its
own node. Its corresponding clock nodes are shown below.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Shall be "apm,xgene-qmtm-lite" for QMLite instance
- reg			: First memory resource shall be the QMTM CSR memory
			  resource.
			  Second memory resource shall be the QMTM IO-Fabric
			  memory resource.
- slave-name		: Shall be "CPU_QMTM3" which is receiver for ingress
			  work messages for the QMTM. Here receiver is CPU.
- interrupts		: First interrupt resource shall be the QMTM Error
			  interrupt.
			  Remaining interrupt resources shall be the Ingress
			  work message interrupt mapping for receiver,
			  receiving work messages for the QMTM.
- clocks		: Reference to the clock entry.

Optional properties:
- status		: Shall be "ok" if enabled or "disabled" if disabled.
			  Default is "ok".

Example:
		qmlclk: qmlclk {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-device-clock";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clock-names = "qmlclk";
			status = "ok";
			csr-offset = <0x0>;
			csr-mask = <0x3>;
			enable-offset = <0x8>;
			enable-mask = <0x3>;
		};

		qmlite: qmtm@17030000 {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-qmtm-lite";
			reg = <0x0 0x17030000 0x0 0x10000>,
			      <0x0 0x10000000 0x0 0x400000>;
			slave-name = "CPU_QMTM3";
			interrupts = <0x0 0x40 0x4>,
				     <0x0 0x3c 0x4>;
			status = "ok";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&qmlclk 0>;
		};
